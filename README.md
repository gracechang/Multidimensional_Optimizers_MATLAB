# Multidimensional Optimizers
These were written for part of a homework for one of my classes (CPNS 31100). I thought that saving these particular algorithms would be interesting/helpful.


Because this was written originally for a class, the algorithms were written with a function in mind. Please look at `math_details.pdf` for more information.

## Algorithms Written
[Newton's Method in Optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method_in_optimization) (`newton.m`)

[Gradient Descent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) (`graddes.m`)

[Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenberg%E2%80%93Marquardt_algorithm) (`leven.m`)


### Other Functions
`grad.m`: Gives gradient for the function (with inputs corresponding to the given function. See `math_details.pdf` for more information.

`quadrat.m`: Returns the Y value for the intended function.
